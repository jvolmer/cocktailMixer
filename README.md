# Cocktail-Mixer

This is code for the cocktail-mixer, that is developed at the VDI Cologne Group 4-to-90.

Right now this includes the code for the self-driving Freenove-4WD-Car that is controlled by an Arduino. This car is supposed to transport a cocktail glass and to drive between filling stations to fill the glas. The car gets its commands via radio from another Arduino board - the control.

## Setting prerequisites:
- the floor on which the car travels is a perpendicular grid of black lines. The car gets its travel commands in the form of points on that grid.
