The control sends coordinates to the car via radio signal and therefore sets where the car is heading. The control receives the current location of the car via radio from the car.

You can use the Serial input to choose a coordinate that is sent to the car.

This code has no structure yet and is written with the only purpose that the car code is working as intended.
